# Inner Classes in Java

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Inner Classes in Java**.  
It covers different types of inner classes and how they interact with the outer class.

## Concepts Covered
- Private Inner Classes  
- Public Inner Classes  
- Inner Classes inside a Method  

## Explanation

### 1. Private Inner Class
A private inner class can only be accessed inside its outer class.  
The outer class acts as a **bridge**, exposing behavior through its own methods.

### 2. Public Inner Class
A public inner class can be accessed by both the outer class and other classes  
(using the syntax `OuterClass.InnerClass`).

### 3. Inner Class Inside a Method
An inner class declared inside a method:
- Exists only within that method
- Is used for localized logic
- Cannot be accessed outside the method
