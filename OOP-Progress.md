## Overview
This repository documents my journey learning Java fundamentals with a strong focus on Object-Oriented Programming as preparation for backend development.

## Topics Covered So Far
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors
- Methods (void vs return)
- Encapsulation (private, protected, public)
- Inheritance
- Method overriding
- Basic user input using Scanner

## Current Focus
- Deepening understanding of OOP concepts
- Writing cleaner class structures
- Preparing for backend frameworks like Spring Boot

## Why This Matters for Backend
Understanding OOP is critical for backend development because it forms the foundation of:
- Controllers
- Services
- Data models
- Clean architecture

## Next Steps
- Static Keyword
- Method Overloading
- Object Comparison
- Inner Classes
- Interfaces (Abstraction)
- Enums
- Polymorphism
- Small OOP practice projects
