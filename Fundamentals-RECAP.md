# Java Fundamentals — Learning Recap

This document summarizes the core Java fundamentals I have covered so far
and how each concept contributes to my long-term goal of becoming a
backend-focused Java engineer.

## 1. Basics

### Variables & Data Types
I learned how Java stores and handles data using primitive and reference types.
This is essential for understanding how data flows through backend systems.

### Control Flow (Conditionals)
Using `if`, `else if`, and `switch` statements helped me understand
decision-making logic, which is critical for validating user input
and enforcing backend rules.

### Loops (for, while, do-while)
I practiced iteration using:
- `for` loops for predictable repetitions
- `while` loops for condition-based execution
- `do-while` loops for guaranteed first execution

These are fundamental for processing requests, handling collections,
and implementing backend logic.

## 2. Collections

### Sets
I learned that Sets:
- Store **unique elements**
- Do not allow duplicates
- Are useful for preventing repeated data

This is important in backend systems where data integrity matters.

### Lists
Lists helped me understand:
- Indexed data storage
- Adding, updating, and removing elements
- Accessing sublists

Lists are commonly used to handle records retrieved from databases.

### Maps
Maps introduced the concept of **key–value pairs**, which is central to backend development.

I practiced:
- Storing data using keys
- Retrieving values efficiently
- Using Maps to count occurrences (real-world logic)

This directly relates to how backend systems handle configurations,
sessions, and structured data.

## 3. SQL Injection Awareness (Security Basics)

Through a demo project, I learned:
- How weak SQL queries can be exploited
- Why `PreparedStatement` is safer than string-based queries

Security awareness is critical for backend engineers,
especially when dealing with user input and databases.

## Backend Journey Insight

Learning Java fundamentals is not about speed but **depth and discipline**.
Each topic builds the foundation needed for:
- Writing clean backend logic
- Working with databases
- Understanding frameworks like Spring
- Building secure and scalable systems

I am now transitioning into **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**,
which will allow me to design structured, maintainable backend applications.
